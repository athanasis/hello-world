# MTT (Minimum Time Travel) simulations in Web-GIS

Follow the instructions below to install and run fire behaviour simulations based on the MTT algorithm through a Web-GIS application.The instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The project inculdes a copy of the MTT Fire Behavior Libraries (more details in http://sbrittain.net/FB/FB_API.htm).

### Prerequisites


* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) - The open source package for PHP development environment including Apache Web server
* [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) - The open source server for sharing geospatial data
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
* [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) - The command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - The open source relational database management system (RDBMS)
* [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org) - The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. Follow these instructions (https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/tutorials/installing-gdal-for-windows) to install GDAL 


```
Give examples
```

### Install XAMPP

Install XAMPP and choose Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin as the only components to be installed. Choose an installation folder  where you have full access. If IIS is already used in your machine, open services.msc and disable the World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3svc).

### Install Python

Install XAMPP and choose Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin as the only components to be installed. Choose an installation folder  where you have full access. If IIS is already used in your machine, open services.msc and disable the World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3svc).

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
