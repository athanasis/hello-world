# MTT (Minimum Time Travel) simulations in Web-GIS

Follow the instructions below to install and run fire behaviour simulations based on the MTT algorithm through a Web-GIS application.The instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The project inculdes a copy of the MTT Fire Behavior Libraries (more details in http://sbrittain.net/FB/FB_API.htm).

### Prerequisites


* [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) - The open source server for sharing geospatial data
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - The open source relational database management system (RDBMS)
* [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org) - The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. Follow these instructions (https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/tutorials/installing-gdal-for-windows) to install GDAL 


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
